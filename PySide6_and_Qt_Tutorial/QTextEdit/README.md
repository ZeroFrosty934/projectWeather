# QTextEdit

In this project i learned how QTextEdit works in PySide6. I have created a simple example where i have added a textChanged signal. When the text is changed in the QTextEdit, a message will be shown in the console. I also added buttons like copy, cut, paste, undo and redo. 

What i learned from this example: 
* How to use textChanged signal of QTextEdit
* How to use copy, cut, paste, undo and redo actions in QTextEdit
* How to connect signals to the slots

Packages used:
* PySide6
