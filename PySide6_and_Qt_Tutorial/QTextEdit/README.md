# QTextEdit

In this project i learned how QTextEdit works in PySide6. I created a simple text editor with a QTextEdit widget. I connected the textChanged signal of QTextEdit to a slot that prints the text in the QTextEdit widget. I can also copy, cut, paste, undo and redo the text in the QTextEdit widget. Display Html and Plain text in QTextEdit widget.

What i learned from this example: 
* How to use textChanged signal of QTextEdit
* How to use copy, cut, paste, undo and redo actions in QTextEdit
* How to connect signals to the slots

Packages used:
